# SurvivalProjektPlugin
This is a Minecraft Java Plugin coded by me. Some features are NPCs, Custom Messages, Pets, Grappling hooks, TPA, ChatFilter, Votekick, Marry, Home, Shop, an inv-restore system and much more! Some features don't work because its not up-to-date and partly bad coded. 
It's  not finished (and will probably never be) so don't have too much trust in it 😉
You can edit the code to make it perfect for your server, that's why I made it open source.
I made this plugin for my own little server and that's why there are so many things, that are "special" to my (german) server so if you want to use it, just make sure, that you edit the sourcecode, copy some features or accept some weird translations/features ;) This was also my first plugin and I know it's definetly not perfect lol.
My favorite features are actually lockchest and pets.
Have fun 👍
