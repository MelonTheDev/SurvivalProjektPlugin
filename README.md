# SurvivalProjektPlugin
This is a Minecraft Java Plugin developed by me. Some features are NPCs, Custom Messages, Pets, Grappling hooks, ChatFilter, Votekick(not working LMAO), Marry, Home, Shop, an inv-restore system and much more!
It's still in beta so don't have too much trust in it ðŸ˜‰
You can edit this code to make it perfect for your server, that's why it's open source
I made this plugin for my own little server and that's why there are so many things, that are "special" to my (german) server so if you want to use it, just make sure, that you edit the sourcecode, copy some features or accept some weird translations/features ;) This was also my first plugin and I know it's definetly not perfect LOL
And BTW most of the plugins messages are in german so if you don't want that, you have to translate them :(
